# Ranics

This is a system that will aid in carrying out daily carpack activities in mutall
carpark.

## The Systems Objectives

### Main objectives

1. Provide carpack services.

### Other objectives

1. Help us learn the basic data operations.
2. Aid us in collaborating in programming the system.
3. Be able to write a proposal.
4. Do advanced data management

## **Ranics in Relation to CRUD**

  > C - Create  
  > R - Review  
  > U - Update  
  > D - Delete  

CRUD shows the steps in which data operations occur. The language used is
Structured Query Language (SQL).

`CREATE`

 Data can be created through various ways such as:

- Forms.
- Images.
- Voice Recording.
- Data logger.

 `REVIEW`

This is the act of interrogating data for use.

 `UPDATE`

This includes adding of additional data to an existing data structure or
modifying data after reviewing.

`DELETE`

The act of removing data from a structure.

**SQL Statements and Their Functions**

> Create data - INSERT.  
> Review - SELECT.  
> Update - UPDATE.  
> Delete - DELETE.  

**Additional Statements**

> ALTER -Changes the data structure.  
> CREATE - Creates the data structure.



## Ranics Agenda

Ranics has 7 agenda items which are crucial to the CRUD module.

### Civil Works

##### Quotations

Compare three different quotations from different vendors. For price evaluation and review. Learn how to (JN)

##### Proposal  

Write a proposal of the system for funding request. (DK)

### Automation

##### Data collection  

Collect data for a month for effective review and learning how to manipulate data. (PK)

##### Camera systems

Research and present on how to use a camera system for the carpark. And also find out how the automated carparks operate by visiting three different carparks, how they are installed and implemented, also the modes of payment.(SW)  
How the gate control system works.
