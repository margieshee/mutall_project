# Ranics

This is a system that will aid in carrying out daily carpack activities in mutall
carpark.

## The Systems Objectives

### Main objectives

1. Provide carpack services.

### Other objectives

1. Help us learn the basic data operations.
2. Aid us in collaborating in programming the system.
3. Be able to write a proposal.
4. Do advanced data management

## **Ranics in Relation to CRUD**

  > C - Create  
  > R - Review  
  > U - Update  
  > D - Delete  

CRUD shows the steps in which data operations occur. The language used is
Structured Query Language (SQL).

`CREATE`

 Data can be created through various ways such as:

- Forms.
- Images.
- Voice Recording.
- Data logger.

 `REVIEW`

This is the act of interrogating data for use.

 `UPDATE`

This includes adding of additional data to an existing data structure or
modifying data after reviewing.

`DELETE`

The act of removing data from a structure.

**SQL Statements and Their Functions**

> Create data - INSERT.  
> Review - SELECT.  
> Update - UPDATE.  
> Delete - DELETE.  

**Additional Statements**

> ALTER -Changes the data structure.  
> CREATE - Creates the data structure.



## Ranics Agenda

Ranics has 7 agenda items which are crucial to the CRUD module.
